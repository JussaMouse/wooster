# mlx-box: Super-System Knowledge Base

This document is the central knowledge base for setting up, managing, and backing up the complete mlx-box AI system on macOS for **production, internet-facing deployment**.

---

## 1. System Architecture: A Secure, Layered Defense

This project is architected for security and reliability using a reverse proxy model.

-   **Outer Wall (Firewall):** The `pf` firewall is the first line of defense. It blocks all incoming traffic by default, only allowing connections on the standard web ports (`80/443`) and a custom SSH port.
-   **Gatekeeper (Nginx):** Nginx is the only service exposed to the internet. It terminates SSL (HTTPS) and acts as a secure reverse proxy, routing traffic to the appropriate internal application.
-   **Protected Core (Application Services):** The AI models and web frontend are configured to listen only on `localhost` (`127.0.0.1`), making them completely inaccessible from the outside world. They can only be reached via the Nginx gatekeeper.
-   **Configuration as Code:** All server setup is defined in version-controlled scripts that read from a private, user-managed `config/settings.toml` file.

---

## 2. Full System Provisioning

These steps configure a fresh macOS installation. The `install.sh` script automates this entire section.

### 2.1. Headless Server Configuration

The script configures macOS for "always-on" server reliability: disabling sleep, enabling auto-restart on power failure, enabling Wake for Network Access, and enabling the SSH service.

### 2.2. User Prerequisites

Before running the script, there are three required manual steps: setting up DNS, SSH, and your private configuration file.

1.  **Set Up DNS:**
    For the server to be accessible from the internet via a domain name and for SSL certificates to work, you must configure a DNS 'A' record.

    -   **What is an 'A' Record?** It's a setting at your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare) that points a domain name (like `mlx-box.yourdomain.com`) to a specific IP address.

    -   **How to do it:**
        1.  Find your server's **public IP address**. You can do this by running `curl ifconfig.me` on the server, or by checking your router's administration page.
        2.  Log in to your domain registrar's website.
        3.  Go to the DNS management section for your domain.
        4.  Create a new 'A' record with the following settings:
            -   **Host/Name:** `mlx-box` (or whatever subdomain you want)
            -   **Value/Points to:** Your server's public IP address.
            -   **TTL (Time to Live):** Set to a low value initially (like 300 seconds) if you are testing.

    -   **Important:** DNS changes can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to propagate across the internet. You can use a tool like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org/) to see when your new record is live before running the installer.

2.  **Configure Port Forwarding on Your Router:**
    To allow external traffic from the internet to reach your server, you must set up port forwarding on your router.

    -   **How to do it:**
        1.  Find your server's **local IP address** (e.g., `192.168.1.xxx`) by running `ipconfig getifaddr en0` on the server.
        2.  Log in to your router's administration web page.
        3.  Find the "Port Forwarding" section (it may be called "Virtual Servers" or similar).
        4.  Create the following three rules to forward traffic to your server's local IP:
            -   **SSH:** External Port `333` -> Internal Port `333` (TCP)
            -   **HTTP:** External Port `80` -> Internal Port `80` (TCP)
            -   **HTTPS:** External Port `443` -> Internal Port `443` (TCP)
        5.  Save and apply the changes. Your router may need to reboot.

3.  **Set Up SSH Access:**
    Place your client's public SSH key into the `authorized_keys` file on the server.
    ```sh
    mkdir -p /Users/env/.ssh && echo "ssh-ed25519 AAA..." > /Users/env/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 700 /Users/env/.ssh && chmod 600 /Users/env/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

4.  **Create and Edit Your Configuration File:**
    Copy the configuration templates and customize them with your domain, email, and other settings. The `.toml` file is used by the Python services, and the `.env` file is used by the installation scripts.
    ```sh
    cp config/settings.toml.example config/settings.toml
    cp config/settings.env.example config/settings.env
    hx config/settings.toml
    hx config/settings.env
    ```

### 2.3. Running the Installer

With the prerequisites met, run the master script from the project directory:
```sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
The script is idempotent and safe to re-run. It will install all tools, dynamically generate configuration files (`pf.conf`, `nginx.conf`), install all services, and attempt to obtain an SSL certificate.

---

## 3. Configuration Explained

The server is configured using two files in the `config/` directory.

### `settings.env` (for the installer)

This file uses a simple `KEY=VALUE` format and is used by the shell scripts (`install.sh`, `update-model.sh`, etc.) to configure the server environment. You must copy the example file and edit it before running the installer.

-   `DOMAIN_NAME`: **Required.** Your server's public domain name.
-   `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL`: **Required.** Your email for SSL certificate registration.
-   `SSH_PORT`: The custom port for your SSH service.
-   `CHAT_PORT`, `EMBED_PORT`, `FRONTEND_PORT`: The internal `localhost` ports for the application services.

### `settings.toml` (for the AI services)

This file is used exclusively by the Python-based AI services (`chat-server.py`, `embed-server.py`) to select which models to load.

-   `model`: The Hugging Face model ID for the chat and embedding services. You can change this to use any compatible model from the `mlx-community` library.

---

## 4. Model Management

You can easily switch to a new chat model without re-running the entire installation.

### Using the `update-model.sh` Script

The simplest method is to use the provided `update-model.sh` script. It will automatically update your configuration, restart the service, and show you the download progress.

```sh
# Make the script executable (only need to do this once)
chmod +x update-model.sh

# Run the script with the new model ID
./update-model.sh mlx-community/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-4bit
```

The script will handle the rest. The server will download the new model (which can take some time) and load it.

---

## System daemon: running the chat server as a LaunchDaemon

When installing `mlx-box` as a system-level service, running a user-owned `poetry run` command directly from a system LaunchDaemon may fail because system daemons run in a root context without a user shell. To avoid environment and permission mismatches we use a small, root-owned launcher script that executes the project's Poetry virtualenv Python with absolute paths.

Note: The installer (`models/startup-services-install.sh`) now automatically creates the root-owned launchers in `/usr/local/bin` and writes the LaunchDaemon plists to call them. The manual steps below are provided for reference and for customizing installs.

Why this matters
- `launchd` will refuse or repeatedly fail a plist that tries to invoke user-shell helpers (like `poetry run`) from the system domain.
- A root-owned launcher bridges the gap: it runs as root, sets the correct `HOME`, `cd`'s to the project `WorkingDirectory`, and `exec`'s the venv python with the absolute path to `chat-server.py`.

Quick install (admin steps)

1.  Create the launcher (run as an admin):

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo tee /usr/local/bin/mlx-chat-launcher.sh > /dev/null <<'SH'
#!/bin/bash
export HOME="/Users/env"
VENV_PY="/Users/env/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/models-qHyjAnJ_-py3.11/bin/python3"
SCRIPT="/Users/env/server/mlx-box/models/chat-server.py"
cd /Users/env/server/mlx-box/models || exit 1
exec "$VENV_PY" "$SCRIPT"
SH
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/mlx-chat-launcher.sh
sudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/bin/mlx-chat-launcher.sh
```

2.  Replace the LaunchDaemon `ProgramArguments` with the launcher (backup first) â€” if you used the installer, this is already done:

```sh
sudo cp /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.local.mlx-chat-server.plist /tmp/com.local.mlx-chat-server.plist.bak
sudo tee /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.local.mlx-chat-server.plist > /dev/null <<'PLIST'
... (plist that calls /usr/local/bin/mlx-chat-launcher.sh) ...
PLIST
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.local.mlx-chat-server.plist
sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.local.mlx-chat-server.plist
```

3.  Ensure log directory exists and is owned by the service user:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /Users/env/Library/Logs/com.local.mlx-chat-server
sudo chown -R env:staff /Users/env/Library/Logs/com.local.mlx-chat-server
sudo chmod 755 /Users/env/Library/Logs/com.local.mlx-chat-server
```

4.  Bootstrap and start the daemon (or re-bootstrap after changes):

```sh
sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.local.mlx-chat-server.plist 2>/dev/null || true
sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.local.mlx-chat-server.plist
sudo launchctl start com.local.mlx-chat-server
tail -f /Users/env/Library/Logs/com.local.mlx-chat-server/stderr.log
```

Notes
- If you prefer the service to run under your user environment (so `poetry run` works natively), install the plist as a **LaunchAgent** in `~/Library/LaunchAgents` and bootstrap it from a GUI session. The launcher approach is recommended for system daemons.

## Restricting HTTPS access (IP allowlist)

You can restrict HTTPS (port 443) to specific client IPs using the `ALLOWED_IPS` setting. The installer will generate the allow/deny directives inside the `listen 443 ssl;` server block in nginx.

1. Set the allowlist in `config/settings.env` (comma-separated, no spaces):
```sh
echo 'ALLOWED_IPS=1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8' >> config/settings.env
```

2. Re-run the installer (safe to re-run), or reload nginx after regeneration:
```sh
./install.sh
# or, if nginx.conf is already regenerated
BREW_PREFIX=$(brew --prefix)
sudo nginx -t -c "$BREW_PREFIX/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/homebrew.mxcl.nginx
```

3. Verify the active config contains the allow/deny lines under the 443 block:
```sh
BREW_PREFIX=$(brew --prefix)
sudo nginx -T -c "$BREW_PREFIX/etc/nginx/nginx.conf" | egrep -n 'listen 443|allow |deny all'
```

Notes
- If `ALLOWED_IPS` is empty, no allow/deny directives are added and 443 is publicly accessible.
- Use your public IPs (as seen by the server). If you are behind another proxy, consider enabling a trusted-proxy setup with `real_ip`.

## 5. Updating Your Server

To update your server to the latest version of the `mlx-box` code, follow this procedure. This process is designed to be safe and to preserve your existing configuration and data.

### Step 1: Back Up Your System
Before any update, perform a full backup of your critical data. This gives you a safe restore point.
```sh
# Navigate to your home directory for the backup file
cd ~
# Create a timestamped backup of your config and SSL certs
sudo tar -czvf mlx-box-backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /Users/env/server/config /etc/letsencrypt
```

### Step 2: Fetch the Latest Code
Navigate to the project directory and pull the latest changes from the Git repository.
    ```sh
    cd /Users/env/server
    git pull origin main # Or your primary branch
    ```

### Step 3: Review Configuration Changes
New versions of the server may introduce new settings. It's crucial to compare your private configuration with the new template.
```sh
# Use the 'diff' command to see what's new in the example file
diff config/settings.toml config/settings.toml.example
```
After reviewing the differences, manually copy any new settings from the `.example` file into your main `config/settings.toml` and configure them.

### Step 4: Update Dependencies
The new code may require new or updated Python libraries. Run `poetry install` to sync your environment.
```sh
(cd models && poetry install)
```

### Step 5: Re-run the Master Installer
The `install.sh` script is designed to be safely re-run for updates. It will intelligently apply the latest configurations, restart services, and ensure the system is in the correct state.
    ```sh
    ./install.sh
    ```

### Step 6: Verify the Update
After the script completes, check that the services are running and accessible.
```sh
# Check the status of the Nginx service
sudo launchctl list | grep nginx

# Check the application logs for any errors
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/com.mlx-box.frontend-server/stderr.log
```

## 6. Backup and Disaster Recovery

The backup strategy separates private user data from public, replaceable code.

### 5.1. What to Back Up
-   The entire `config/` directory.
-   The SSL certificates managed by certbot: `/etc/letsencrypt/`
-   **System Configurations (for reference):** While the installer script regenerates these, the backups it creates (e.g., in `/opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/`) can be useful.

**Example Backup Command:**
```sh
# Create a timestamped backup archive of critical data
sudo tar -czvf mlx-box-backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /Users/env/server/config /etc/letsencrypt
```

### 5.2. Restore Procedure
1.  Provision a fresh server using the `install.sh` script (after setting up DNS, SSH, and your `config/` files).
2.  Transfer your latest backup file to the server.
3.  Unpack the backup archive from the root directory:
    ```sh
    # This will restore your config and SSL certs
    sudo tar -xzvf mlx-box-backup-2024-01-01.tar.gz -C /
    ```
4.  Restart the services (`sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/homebrew.mxcl.nginx`, etc.) to use the restored configurations.

*(Other sections like `wooster` installation, service management, and troubleshooting would be updated to reflect the new Nginx-based URLs and localhost-only service access.)*

## Scripts: System Info and Reports

These helper scripts capture system details and generate a consolidated report for post-install validation and ongoing troubleshooting.

### `scripts/collect_system_info.sh`

- Purpose: Snapshot key system facts (OS, CPU, RAM, disk free, primary IP, Hugging Face cache, project directory) into an env file for reuse.
- Output: Writes `config/system-info.env`.
- Run manually:
    ```sh
    scripts/collect_system_info.sh
    cat config/system-info.env
    ```

### `scripts/generate_system_report.sh`

- Purpose: Produce a timestamped, human-readable report aggregating system info, service status, nginx config, certbot status, firewall rules, and tails of critical logs.
- Output: Saves under `reports/` as `system-report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt`.
- Auto-run: Executed automatically by `install.sh` on success.
- Run manually anytime:
    ```sh
    scripts/generate_system_report.sh
    ls -1 reports/
    ```

## Unified logging and monitoring plan (proposal)

This section outlines a practical plan to centralize logs, add lightweight 1-minute system metrics, and trigger admin alerts on thresholds. Implementation will be staged in scripts and services.

### Logging sources to unify
- Application/API:
  - Python services (`models/chat-server.py`, `models/embed-server.py`): structured stdout/stderr to `~/Library/Logs/com.local.{service}/` via `launchd`.
  - Nginx access/error logs: include client IP, time, status, and authenticated user if basic auth is enabled.
- Frontend:
  - `http-server` stderr/stdout already captured by `com.mlx-box.frontend-server` logs; keep directory listings disabled (`-d`).

### Access and auth logging
- Enable Nginx `log_format` to capture: `$remote_addr`, `$remote_user`, `$time_local`, `$request`, `$status`, `$body_bytes_sent`, `$http_referer`, `$http_user_agent`.
- With basic auth enabled on 443, `$remote_user` will indicate the login user. Failed auth attempts appear in the error log.

### Historical diagnostics (every 1 minute)
- Collector script (to be added): `scripts/monitor_poll.sh` will append one-line CSV samples to `logs/metrics.csv` with:
  - timestamp, cpu_percent, gpu_util (if available on Apple GPU), mem_used_percent, net_bytes_in/s, net_bytes_out/s, disk_used_percent
- Scheduling: Install as a `launchd` agent/daemon with a StartInterval of 60 seconds.
- Storage/retention: Rotate metrics weekly; keep 30 days by default.

### Thresholds and alerts
- Config in `config/settings.env` (to be added):
  - `ALERT_EMAIL=admin@example.com`
  - `ALERT_CPU_PCT=90`
  - `ALERT_MEM_PCT=90`
  - `ALERT_DISK_PCT=90`
  - `ALERT_NET_MBPS=800` (optional)
- Alerting transport:
  - Email via the system `postfix` (macOS) using `mail`/`sendmail`, or configure an SMTP relay (e.g., `msmtp`) if `postfix` is disabled.
  - Optional webhook (Slack/Discord) via `curl` for redundancy.
- Alert policy:
  - Trigger when a threshold is exceeded for 3 consecutive samples (3 minutes) to reduce noise.
  - Send one notification per incident with a cool-down window (e.g., 30 minutes) unless the severity increases.

### Admin report and triage
- On each successful `install.sh` run, a full report is generated (see above). For incidents, the alert includes the last 20 lines of:
  - Nginx error log
  - Chat server log
  - Embed server log
  - Recent metrics window from `logs/metrics.csv`

### Implementation checklist (next steps)
- Add `scripts/monitor_poll.sh` to sample metrics portably on macOS.
- Add a `launchd` plist to schedule the poller every 60s.
- Extend `install.sh` to install/start the poller and to read alert thresholds from `config/settings.env` when present.
- Add an alert sender (`scripts/send_alert.sh`) that supports email and optional webhook.
- Document rotation and retention in `README.md` and add `logs/` to `.gitignore` (keep this directory local-only).
