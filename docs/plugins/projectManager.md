# Wooster Plugin: Project Manager (`projectManager`)\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThe `ProjectManagerPlugin` provides tools for managing projects within Wooster. Its key capabilities include creating new projects and opening existing ones, automatically setting them as the active project within Wooster's core system.\n\nFuture enhancements could include listing projects or other project-specific operations.\n\n## 2. Setup & Configuration\n\nTo enable this plugin, ensure the following environment variable is set in your `.env` file:\n\n```env\nPLUGIN_PROJECTMANAGER_ENABLED=true\n```\n\nThe plugin relies on the `projects` base directory (typically `projects/` relative to Wooster's root) to find and create project directories.\n\n## 3. Provided Agent Tools\n\n### 3.1. `createProject`\n\n*   **Name:** `createProject`\n*   **Description:** Creates a new project with the given name and sets it as the active project. Usage: `createProject project_name`\n*   **Input:** `projectName: string` - The desired name for the new project. This should be a single string argument provided to the tool.\n*   **Functionality:**\n    *   Takes the provided `projectName`.\n    *   Uses the `createNewProject` utility (`src/plugins/projectManager/createNewProject.ts`) to perform the actual file system operations. This involves creating a new directory named `projectName` (e.g., `projects/MyNewProject/`).\n    *   It also creates a main Markdown file within this new directory (e.g., `projects/MyNewProject/MyNewProject.md`) populated with default headings.\n    *   **Crucially, it then attempts to set this newly created project as the active project within Wooster's core system.**\n*   **Output:**\n    *   On success: Returns a message like `"Project '[projectName]' created successfully. Path: [path/to/projectName.md]. It is now the active project."` or a message indicating if activation was not possible (though this is less likely with recent core changes).\n    *   On failure (e.g., project already exists, invalid name, configuration issue, file system error): Returns an error message like `"Error creating project: [reason]"`.\n*   **Example Agent Interaction:**\n    ```\n    User: create new project AlphaFoxtrot\n    Agent: (Calls `createProject` tool with "AlphaFoxtrot")\n    Tool Response: Project 'AlphaFoxtrot' created successfully. Path: projects/AlphaFoxtrot/AlphaFoxtrot.md. It is now the active project.\n    Agent: Okay, I've created the project "AlphaFoxtrot" for you, and it's now the active project. The main project file is at projects/AlphaFoxtrot/AlphaFoxtrot.md.\n    ```\n    Or in case of an error:\n    ```\n    User: create new project MyExistingProject\n    Agent: (Calls `createProject` tool with "MyExistingProject")\n    Tool Response: Error creating project: Project 'MyExistingProject' already exists at projects/MyExistingProject.\n    Agent: It looks like a project named "MyExistingProject" already exists at projects/MyExistingProject.\n    ```\n\n### 3.2. `openProject`\n\n*   **Name:** `openProject`\n*   **Description:** Opens an existing project by its name and attempts to set it as the active project. This tool supports fuzzy matching for the project name.\n*   **Input:** `projectName: string` - The name of the project to open.\n*   **Functionality:**\n    *   Takes the provided `projectName`.\n    *   Uses an internal helper (`findMatchingProjectName`) to find the best match for the project name among the existing project directories (e.g., in `projects/`). It attempts exact matches, case-insensitive matches, and normalized matches (ignoring spaces, hyphens, underscores).\n    *   If a clear match is found, it calls the `setActiveProjectInCore` utility to request Wooster's core system to make this project the active one. This involves re-initializing the project-specific vector store and updating the agent's context.\n    *   If no match is found, or if the input is too ambiguous (matching multiple projects equally well), it informs the user.\n*   **Output:**\n    *   **Success:** `"Project '[matchedProjectName]' is now the active project."`\n    *   **No Match:** `"No project found matching '[projectName]'."`\n    *   **Ambiguous Match:** `"Your request '[projectName]' is ambiguous and could refer to multiple projects: [list of matches]. Please be more specific."`\n    *   **Error:** `"Error opening project '[projectName]': [reason]"` (e.g., if setting active fails unexpectedly).\n*   **Example Agent Interaction:**\n    ```\n    User: open project my notes\n    Agent: (Calls `openProject` tool with "my notes")\n    Tool Response: Project 'My Notes' is now the active project.\n    Agent: Okay, I've opened your project "My Notes" and it's now the active project.\n    ```\n    ```\n    User: open project nonExistent\n    Agent: (Calls `openProject` tool with "nonExistent")\n    Tool Response: No project found matching 'nonExistent'.\n    Agent: I couldn't find a project named "nonExistent".\n    ```\n\n## 4. Dependencies\n\n*   `createNewProject` utility from `src/plugins/projectManager/createNewProject.ts` for project creation logic.\n*   `setActiveProjectInCore` utility from `src/setActiveProject.ts` for interacting with the core project activation mechanism.\n*   Relies on the `CoreServices.setActiveProject` method being available from Wooster's core.\n*   Application Configuration (`AppConfig`) to determine project paths.\n*   Logger (`src/logger.ts`).\n*   `fs` module for file system interactions.\n\n## 5. Future Enhancements\n\n*   Tool to list existing projects.\n*   Tools for archiving or deleting projects.
