# Wooster Plugin: Project Manager (`projectManager`)\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nThe `ProjectManagerPlugin` provides tools for managing projects within Wooster. Its initial capability is to allow users to create new projects directly via an agent command.\n\nFuture enhancements could include listing projects, setting an active project, or other project-specific operations.\n\n## 2. Setup & Configuration\n\nTo enable this plugin, ensure the following environment variable is set in your `.env` file:\n\n```env\nPLUGIN_PROJECTMANAGER_ENABLED=true\n```\n\nThe plugin relies on the `GTD_PROJECTS_DIR` setting (typically configured in `AppConfig.gtd.projectsDir` via environment variables like `GTD_PROJECTS_DIR=projects/`) to know where to create new project directories. Ensure this is properly configured.\n\n## 3. Provided Agent Tools\n\n### 3.1. `createProject`\n\n*   **Name:** `createProject`\n*   **Description:** Creates a new project with the given name. Usage: `createProject project_name`\n*   **Input:** `projectName: string` - The desired name for the new project. This should be a single string argument provided to the tool.\n*   **Functionality:**\n    *   Takes the provided `projectName`.\n    *   Uses the `createNewProject` utility (`src/newProject.ts`) to perform the actual file system operations.\n    *   This involves creating a new directory named `projectName` within the configured `GTD_PROJECTS_DIR` (e.g., `projects/MyNewProject/`).\n    *   It also creates a main Markdown file within this new directory (e.g., `projects/MyNewProject/MyNewProject.md`) populated with default headings (Overview, Tasks, Notes, Reference Material).\n*   **Output:**\n    *   On success: Returns a message like `"Project '[projectName]' created successfully. Path: [path/to/projectName.md]"`.\n    *   On failure (e.g., project already exists, invalid name, configuration issue, file system error): Returns an error message like `"Error creating project: [reason]"`.\n*   **Example Agent Interaction:**\n    ```\n    User: create new project AlphaFoxtrot\n    Agent: (Calls `createProject` tool with "AlphaFoxtrot")\n    Tool Response: Project 'AlphaFoxtrot' created successfully. Path: projects/AlphaFoxtrot/AlphaFoxtrot.md\n    Agent: Okay, I've created the project "AlphaFoxtrot" for you. The main project file is at projects/AlphaFoxtrot/AlphaFoxtrot.md.\n    ```\n    Or in case of an error:\n    ```\n    User: create new project MyExistingProject\n    Agent: (Calls `createProject` tool with "MyExistingProject")\n    Tool Response: Error creating project: Project 'MyExistingProject' already exists at projects/MyExistingProject.\n    Agent: It looks like a project named "MyExistingProject" already exists at projects/MyExistingProject.\n    ```\n\n## 4. Dependencies\n\n*   `createNewProject` utility from `src/newProject.ts` for the core project creation logic.\n*   Application Configuration (`AppConfig`) to access `gtd.projectsDir`.\n*   Logger (`src/logger.ts`).\n\n## 5. Future Enhancements\n\n*   Tool to list existing projects.\n*   Tool to set the current "active" project context within Wooster (if such a concept is formalized).\n*   Tools for archiving or deleting projects.
