# Wooster Plugin Development Guide

This guide provides instructions and best practices for developing plugins for Wooster. Adhering to these guidelines will help ensure your plugins are correctly loaded, initialized, and integrated into the Wooster ecosystem.

## Core Concepts

Wooster's `PluginManager` is responsible for discovering, loading, validating, and initializing all plugins. Plugins can extend Wooster's functionality by registering new agent tools, providing services, or scheduling background tasks.

## Plugin Structure

A plugin is typically a TypeScript class contained within its own directory under `src/plugins/`. For example, a plugin named "myPlugin" would reside in `src/plugins/myPlugin/`.

### Entry Point: `index.ts`

The main file for your plugin must be `src/plugins/yourPluginName/index.ts`. This file should contain the main plugin class and export it as the default export.

### Plugin Class Definition

Your plugin class must implement the `WoosterPlugin` interface (from `src/types/plugin.ts`).

#### 1. Static Properties (Crucial for Loading & Validation)

The `PluginManager` validates plugins by expecting certain static properties on the plugin's default exported class constructor. These properties are read *before* the plugin is instantiated. **If these static properties are not correctly defined on the class constructor, the `PluginManager` will not be able to recognize or load your plugin.**

-   **`pluginName` (string):** (Recommended) The canonical, unique name for your plugin (e.g., `'myPlugin'`). This is used as the key in configuration files (e.g., `config.plugins.myPlugin`) and for logging. While `name` is also checked for backward compatibility, `pluginName` is preferred to avoid conflicts with `Function.name`.
-   **`version` (string):** The version number of your plugin (e.g., `'0.1.0'`).
-   **`description` (string):** A brief description of what your plugin does.

These properties **must** be defined as `static readonly` on your plugin class.

**Example:**

```typescript
// src/plugins/myPlugin/index.ts
import { WoosterPlugin, AppConfig, CoreServices, LogLevel } from '../../types/plugin'; // Adjust path as needed

export class MyPlugin implements WoosterPlugin {
  // Static properties for PluginManager
  static readonly pluginName = 'myPlugin';
  static readonly version = '1.0.0';
  static readonly description = 'This plugin demonstrates best practices.';

  // Instance properties to satisfy WoosterPlugin interface (can mirror static ones)
  readonly name = MyPlugin.pluginName;
  readonly version = MyPlugin.version;
  readonly description = MyPlugin.description;

  private config!: AppConfig;
  private services!: CoreServices;

  async initialize(config: AppConfig, services: CoreServices): Promise<void> {
    this.config = config;
    this.services = services;
    this.services.log(LogLevel.INFO, `MyPlugin (v${MyPlugin.version}): Initialized successfully.`);
    // Initialization logic for your plugin
  }

  async shutdown(): Promise<void> {
    this.services.log(LogLevel.INFO, `MyPlugin (v${MyPlugin.version}): Shutting down.`);
    // Cleanup logic for your plugin
  }

  // Optional: getAgentTools, getScheduledTaskSetups, etc.
  // getAgentTools?(): DynamicTool[] { /* ... */ }
}

export default MyPlugin; // Default export the class
```

#### 2. Default Export

Your plugin's `index.ts` file **must** have a `default export` of the plugin class itself.
`export default MyPluginClass;`

**Important:** Do **not** export an instance of your class (e.g., `export default new MyPluginClass();`). The `PluginManager` is responsible for creating an instance of your plugin class after validating its static properties.

#### 3. Plugin Lifecycle Methods

The `WoosterPlugin` interface defines several lifecycle methods. After validating the static properties and creating an instance of your plugin, the `PluginManager` will call these methods on that **instance**.

-   **`async initialize(config: AppConfig, services: CoreServices): Promise<void>`:**
    Called when the plugin is loaded. Use this to set up your plugin, store the provided `config` and `services` on `this` for later use, register services, etc.
-   **`async shutdown(): Promise<void>`:**
    Called when Wooster is shutting down. Use this for any cleanup tasks.
-   **`getAgentTools?(): DynamicTool[]`:** (Optional)
    If your plugin provides tools for the AI agent, implement this method to return an array of `DynamicTool` instances.
-   **`getScheduledTaskSetups?(): ScheduledTaskSetupOptions | ScheduledTaskSetupOptions[]`:** (Optional)
    If your plugin needs to run background tasks on a schedule, implement this to return setup options.

Since these methods are called on an instance, you can safely use `this` to access instance properties (like `this.config` or `this.services` that you stored during `initialize`).

## Compilation

Wooster is a TypeScript project. Your plugin's TypeScript code will be compiled into JavaScript and output to the `dist/` directory. The `PluginManager` loads plugins from their compiled JavaScript versions (e.g., `dist/plugins/myPlugin/index.js`).

-   Ensure your TypeScript code is free of compilation errors.
-   The build process (e.g., `pnpm build`) handles the compilation.

## Development Environment and Linting

A correctly configured development environment is crucial for smooth plugin development, especially for catching errors early.

### ESLint Setup (v9+)

Wooster uses ESLint for code linting. As of ESLint v9.0.0, the default configuration file is `eslint.config.js`. Ensure this file exists at the root of the project.

**Example `eslint.config.js` for TypeScript:**

```javascript
// eslint.config.js
import eslintJs from "@eslint/js";
import tseslint from "typescript-eslint";

export default tseslint.config(
  eslintJs.configs.recommended,
  ...tseslint.configs.recommended,
  {
    // Optional: custom rules or overrides can go here
    // For example, to ignore specific files or directories:
    ignores: ["dist/**", "node_modules/**", "*.log", "coverage/**"], // Added coverage
  },
  {
    // Ensure TS files are linted
    files: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"], // Can also include .js, .jsx if needed
    rules: {
      // Add any project-specific rule overrides here
      // e.g., "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "warn"
    }
  }
);
```

### Required ESLint Packages

Ensure you have the necessary ESLint packages installed as development dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install -D eslint typescript-eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

-   `eslint`: The core ESLint library.
-   `typescript-eslint`: Provides TypeScript support for ESLint (especially for the `eslint.config.js` format).
-   `@typescript-eslint/parser`: Allows ESLint to parse TypeScript code.
-   `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`: Provides TypeScript-specific linting rules.

### Verifying LangChain JS/TS Imports

When using LangChain libraries (e.g., `@langchain/community`, `@langchain/core`):
-   Always refer to the latest official LangChain JS/TS documentation for correct import paths and class/member names for the specific version you are using.
-   Incorrect imports are a common source of errors. A properly configured linter (as set up above) should help catch these.

### Managing Peer Dependencies

Some LangChain modules, especially those interacting with external libraries or native bindings, may have peer dependencies.
-   For example, `@langchain/community/vectorstores/faiss` requires `faiss-node` to be installed.
-   Ensure these peer dependencies are listed in your `package.json` and correctly installed.
-   If you encounter issues related to peer dependencies with `pnpm`, running `pnpm install` usually resolves them. In more complex workspace setups or if linking issues are suspected, `pnpm install --shamefully-hoist` might be considered, but use it judiciously as it alters the standard `node_modules` structure.

### Recommended Workflow for Errors

If you encounter import errors, build failures, or unexpected runtime behavior with your plugin:
1.  **Check Dependencies:** Ensure all project and plugin-specific dependencies (including peer dependencies) are correctly installed (`pnpm install`).
2.  **Lint Your Code:** Run the linter (e.g., `pnpm eslint .`) to identify syntax errors, incorrect imports, or type issues.
3.  **Clean and Rebuild:**
    *   Delete the `dist/` directory.
    *   Execute a clean build (`pnpm build`).
4.  **Review Wooster Logs:** Check the application logs for detailed error messages from the `PluginManager` or the plugin itself.

## Troubleshooting Plugin Loading

If your plugin isn't loading or you see warnings in the console:

1.  **Check Wooster Logs:** Look for messages from the `PluginManager`, especially:
    *   `Module at "..." does not export a valid Wooster plugin class. Missing or invalid static properties: ...`
    *   Errors related to module import or instantiation.
2.  **Verify Static Properties:**
    *   Are `pluginName` (or `name`), `version`, and `description` defined as `static readonly` strings on your plugin class?
3.  **Verify Default Export:**
    *   Is your plugin class the `default export` of its `index.ts` file?
4.  **Clean and Rebuild:**
    *   Delete the `dist/` directory entirely.
    *   Re-run the build command (e.g., `pnpm build`).
    *   Restart Wooster.
5.  **Inspect Compiled Output:**
    *   Check the generated JavaScript file for your plugin in `dist/plugins/yourPluginName/index.js`.
    *   Does it correctly show the static properties on the constructor?
    *   Is the class being correctly exported via `exports.default = ...;` (or the ESM equivalent if your tsconfig targets that)?
6.  **Configuration:**
    *   Ensure your plugin is enabled in the configuration (usually via environment variables like `PLUGIN_YOURPLUGINNAME_ENABLED=true`, which are mapped in `config/custom-environment-variables.json`). Check `.env.example` for patterns.
7.  **Dependency and Linter Checks (Recap from above):**
    *   Are all necessary npm packages, including LangChain modules and any peer dependencies (like `faiss-node` for `FaissStore`), installed correctly?
    *   Is your ESLint configuration (`eslint.config.js`) set up correctly for TypeScript, and are there any linting errors related to your plugin's imports or code? Run `pnpm eslint .` to check.

By following these guidelines, you can create robust and well-integrated plugins for Wooster.
