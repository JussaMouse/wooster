what do these isights mean for the nuts and bolts of our combined RAG+personal obsidian vault personal library/knowledge base? what does an example foss software stack/ project directory structure look like? (lets just call it "the personal library")

Nuts and bolts: how the “personal library” should work
• Ingestion/partitioning (typed, incremental)
Parse Markdown with YAML frontmatter; extract headings, paragraphs, code blocks; compute content hashes per block.
Resolve wikilinks/aliases; build link graph and tag index; detect unlinked mentions.
Watch filesystem (chokidar) to queue only changed files; debounce bursts.
• Storage layout (local-first, FOSS)
Metadata/FTS: SQLite (FTS5) or DuckDB for tables, full‑text, and traces.
Vectors: Qdrant (local) for HNSW vector index; store only ids and vector metadata; keep embeddings on the fly.
Embeddings: local MLX server via mlx‑box (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding-4B); fallback to remote if needed.
Reranker: local small cross‑encoder (e.g., bge‑reranker) or LLM scoring as fallback.
• Retrieval (hybrid, grounded)
Step 1: FTS5 lexical topN; Step 2: Qdrant dense topN; merge/dedupe.
Step 3: Cross‑encoder re‑rank by query↔chunk; Step 4: return contexts with citations (note id + block span).
Optional: k‑hop graph expansion for strong backlinks/transclusions.
• Identity and resilience
Immutable id per note (frontmatter id), mutable title, multiple aliases.
Prefer links by id; write display text as title; maintain alias table for robust resolution.
• Jobs/ops (local queue + scheduler)
Ingestion queue (SQLite‑backed) with retries/backoff; nightly eval suite; daily “unlinked mentions” and “orphan notes” via Signal.
Persist per‑query retrieval traces (before/after re‑rank) for debugging.
• Agent tools (TypeScript APIs)
kb_ingest(globs|paths), kb_query(query, scope), zk_create/rename/alias/link, zk_suggest_links(id), kb_eval(suite).
Enforce citations in answers; prefer hybrid retrieval for factual queries.
• Observability/evals
Trace object per query: inputs, FTS hits, vector hits, rerank scores, latencies.
Lightweight eval harness; rolling metrics summarized in Daily Review.
Example FOSS stack
• Language/runtime: TypeScript (Node.js)
• File watching: chokidar
• Markdown/AST: remark/unified, gray‑matter (frontmatter)
• HTML/PDF/docx: cheerio, pdfjs/pdf-parse, mammoth
• DB: SQLite (better‑sqlite3) or DuckDB for tables, FTS5, and traces
• Vector DB: Qdrant (local service) with HTTP client
• Embeddings: mlx‑box hosting Qwen3‑Embedding‑4B; simple HTTP embedding endpoint
• Reranker: local cross‑encoder (ONNX/MLX) or LLM rerank fallback
• Scheduler: Croner; local SQLite job queue
• Logs: pino/winston JSON logs + trace tables
• UI: minimal Next.js panel in existing frontend plugin for traces/graph

Retrieval flow (concise)
1) FTS5 search → topN_lexical
2) Qdrant vector search → topN_dense
3) Merge/dedupe → candidates
4) Cross‑encoder rerank → topK
5) Expand neighbors (optional graph k‑hop)
6) Return contexts + citations; log trace
This gives you a robust, local-first Obsidian-compatible library with Agentset-inspired ingestion quality, hybrid retrieval accuracy, and evaluability, while integrating seamlessly with Wooster’s scheduler and Signal delivery.


1) is it compatible with some kind of llm router such that we can only "search the RAG" for answers when requested or implied, and give chatbot general response/tool calls otherwise?

2) since this personal library is home for two different types of data (RAG based on my books/videos/text and also my personal notes), is it possible to give it certain usesul capabilities for the latter (ie. "new note", "edit note", "export all notes as .md files to backup")?

1) Router compatibility (only “search the library” when needed)
Yes. Keep two lanes:
General chat/tooling: normal agent behavior, no RAG injection.
Library lookup: invoked only when requested or implied.
How to gate it:
Add a lightweight “KB-needed” classifier step (NONE vs KB). Trigger on phrases like “from my notes/library/book”, “cite”, “show sources”, or when the task demands factual recall.
Expose a single tool kb_query(query, scope) and set a strict system rule: “Call kb_query only when the user asks for knowledge from the library or when you require grounded facts.”
User overrides: “don’t use library” or “search library for …”.
Config flags: kb.auto=false (default on-demand), kb.require_citations=true.
Router integration:
Use your existing ModelRouter to pick chat/embedding models; route kb_query to the hybrid pipeline (FTS + vectors + reranker), return contexts with citations. No change to general chat path.
2) Personal notes capabilities (ZK operations)
Yes. Treat notes as canonical Markdown with YAML frontmatter. Provide tools:
zk_create({ title, body, tags? }) → creates a new note with a stable id and template header.
zk_edit({ id|path, body? , patch? }) → replace full body or apply a diff; safe-write via temp+atomic rename; update updated timestamp.
zk_rename({ id, newTitle }) → keep id stable, add old title to aliases, fix outbound links if configured.
zk_alias({ id, alias }) → append alias for robust link resolution.
zk_link({ srcId, dstRef }) → insert [[dstRef]]; resolve by id/alias/title.
zk_suggest_links({ id }) → candidates from unlinked mentions/hybrid similarity.
zk_list({ filter? }), zk_search({ query }) → list/search notes without full RAG.
zk_export({ dest, include? }) → copy all .md notes (and attachments) to dest or produce a zip; optionally include kb.sqlite and vector index for a full backup.
Scheduling and backups:
Nightly zk_export job to a dated folder/zip.
Daily Signal digest: “unlinked mentions,” “orphans,” “stale notes,” recent edits.
Example tool shapes
Net effect
The router stays in control of when RAG runs; kb_query is on-demand and citation-enforced.
Your notes get first-class CRUD, robust linking/aliases, safe backups, and scheduled curation—without forcing RAG unless asked.

# User Profile integration (kept separate)

- The User Profile remains a separate KB namespace (e.g., `user_profile`) and is not merged with general notes/books.
- Same backend engine (SQLite/FTS + vectors), but excluded from `kb_query` by default; accessed only when explicitly requested (e.g., “recall my …”) or via profile tools (`save_user_profile`, `recall_user_profile`).
- Policy: prefer local-only models for profile operations; opt-in cloud fallback.
- Backups: included as a separate folder/zip in nightly exports; optional encryption.
- Rationale: tiny footprint (no performance concern), reduced risk of leaking personal facts in general answers, and cleaner prompts/evals while still unifying storage/ops.

# Changes to current system:

## Performance: expectations and tuning (after Personal Library integration)

• Expected performance deltas
- Ingestion: First-time ingest will be slower than the legacy JSON vector-store path (typed partitioning + hashing + embeddings). Expect 2–5x initial cost depending on corpus size. Mitigation: fully incremental updates afterwards; only changed blocks re-embed.
- Query latency: Hybrid (FTS5 + vector) + optional re-ranker adds steps. With local SQLite/FTS and local Qdrant/FAISS, target p50 ≈ 60–150 ms and p95 ≈ 200–400 ms for typical queries; streaming answers hide most latency. Classifier gate (NONE vs KB) prevents unnecessary KB calls.
- Disk/memory: SQLite KB + vector index is larger than a JSON store, but scales better. Dimensionality (e.g., 2560 for Qwen3‑4B) impacts disk and RAM; use smaller dims if corpus is large.

• High-impact optimizations (recommended)
- RAG gating: Keep the “KB-needed” classifier strict; default to general chat unless the user asks for library knowledge or citations.
- Incremental ingestion: Content-hash per block; debounce chokidar events; batch and backoff ingestion jobs; skip unchanged files.
- Hybrid retrieval knobs: Use small topN at each stage (e.g., FTS N=50, dense N=50) and re-rank to K=8–12. Dynamically shrink re-ranker usage for easy queries (high lexical margin) and skip for short chatty turns.
- Reranker efficiency: Prefer a small local cross‑encoder (e.g., bge‑reranker‑base via ONNX/MLX). Fall back to MMR when the device is constrained.
- Vector index tuning: If using Qdrant (HNSW), tune m=16–32, ef_construct=100–200, ef_search=64–128. Consider product quantization (PQ) for large corpora; store vectors in f16/int8 when acceptable.
- FTS5 tuning: Use contentless FTS (external content) to avoid duplication; tokenizer=porter; enable `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`, `PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL`, and a negative `PRAGMA cache_size` for larger page cache.
- Embedding speed: Run a local MLX embedding server (see local-embedding-guide) on MPS; batch encode (32–128) with a concurrency cap.
- Warm paths: Pre-open SQLite db, pre-load Qdrant collection, and warm small LRU caches at startup (recent note ids, alias table, tag lexicon).
- Caching: LRU cache recent `kb_query` results keyed by normalized query+scope; TTL 5–15 minutes. Cache unlinked-mention candidates per note.
- Chunking defaults: 300–500 token chunks with 40–60 token overlap; avoid overly small chunks that explode candidate counts.
- Graph-aware expansion: Only expand 1 hop for nodes with high centrality/backlink weight; cap total neighbors to ≤4 to protect latency.

• Operational practices
- Scheduled maintenance: Weekly `VACUUM`/`REINDEX` for SQLite; periodic Qdrant optimizer (if enabled). Rotate logs and traces.
- Sampling evals: Nightly eval suite on a small benchmark set; track p50/p95 latency and answer quality; alert on regressions in Daily Review.
- Observability: Persist per-query trace with timings for FTS, dense search, re-rank, and final selection; sample at 10–25% in production to keep overhead low.

• Sizing guidelines (starting points)
- Chunk length: 400 tokens (±100), overlap 50.
- Retrieval: FTS topN=50, dense topN=50, re-rank to K=10.
- Reranker: enable for queries > 4 tokens or when lexical margin < 0.2; otherwise skip.
- Qdrant HNSW: m=24, ef_search=96 (tune per device); enable f16 storage if RAM pressure.
- Embeddings: If Qwen3‑4B (2560 dims) is heavy, consider Qwen3‑0.6B (1024 dims) with reranker to maintain quality.

• Fast-paths to avoid hits
- Short answers without citations: answer directly (NONE path).
- Non-knowledge tool calls (schedule, Signal, notes CRUD): bypass KB entirely.
- Local-first: keep models/services local to cut network latency; fall back only when needed.

Bottom line: You will notice longer first-time ingest and a small per-query overhead from hybrid retrieval and (sometimes) re-ranking. With gating, batching, tuned indexes, and lightweight reranking, interactive latency remains well within “snappy CLI” expectations while accuracy and grounding improve substantially.

# Frontend plan (no graph view)

• Goals
- Obsidian-like, local-first UI for browsing, searching, and editing notes.
- Default to fast FTS; enable semantic/hybrid on demand; surface backlinks/unlinked mentions.
- Keep it minimal; no graph view.

• MVP scope
- File tree sidebar (folders, tags, recent), note editor/preview, backlinks panel, global search (FTS), create/rename/move notes, atomic save with index status.

• UI layout
- Top bar: search box (mode: Notes/FTS [default], Semantic, Hybrid), filters (tags/folder/date), toggle “Include library”.
- Left sidebar: folders (notes/daily/areas/projects), tags, recent, favorites.
- Main: editor (Markdown) with split preview; right panel shows frontmatter, backlinks, unlinked mentions; status chip (Indexing/Indexed).
- Footer: job queue depth, last ingest time.

• Core interactions
- New note (⌘N) with template (frontmatter id/title/tags). Rename (F2). Move (⌘⇧M).
- [[link]] autocomplete by id/title/alias. Unlinked suggestion accept/add.
- Search: instant FTS; semantic/hybrid runs async with spinner; results show snippets and (for hybrid) cited block spans.

• Backend/API (served by existing frontend plugin)
- Notes CRUD
  - GET /api/notes?query=...&mode=fts|semantic|hybrid&tags=...&folder=...
  - GET /api/notes/:id, POST /api/notes, PUT /api/notes/:id, DELETE /api/notes/:id
  - GET /api/notes/:id/backlinks, GET /api/notes/:id/unlinked, POST /api/notes/:id/rename, POST /api/notes/:id/move
- ZK helpers
  - POST /api/zk/create, POST /api/zk/alias, POST /api/zk/link, POST /api/zk/suggest_links
- KB queries
  - POST /api/kb/query { query, scope: notes|books|all, citations?: boolean }
- System/meta
  - GET /api/kb/status (db open, collection ready, queue depth), GET /api/kb/stats

• Tech choices
- Keep current frontend plugin; serve a small Next.js app or a static SPA (Vite + React) mounted at /.
- Editor: simple Markdown editor (CodeMirror/Monaco minimal config) + preview (remark/rehype).
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (utility-first, fast to iterate) or minimal CSS.
- State: client-side fetch + SWR (stale-while-revalidate) for results; debounce search.

• Performance
- Immediate FTS search; defer semantic/hybrid; virtualized results list.
- Batch save/index signals; display per-note index status.
- LRU cache for recent searches and note metadata; pre-open DB on server start.

• Security/hosting
- Local-only by default; bind to 127.0.0.1; optional basic auth for remote.
- CSRF unnecessary in local trusted mode; enable if exposed.

• Phased rollout
- Phase 1: FTS search, CRUD, backlinks/unlinked, editor/preview, status chip.
- Phase 2: Semantic/hybrid toggle with citations; filters; batch operations (rename/move).
- Phase 3: Link suggestions panel, export ZIP, settings for privacy tags (#private exclude from vectors), keyboard shortcuts.

• Out of scope
- Graph view (explicitly excluded).
