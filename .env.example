# This is an example .env file. Copy to .env and fill in your actual values.
# IMPORTANT: Wooster's core settings (OpenAI API key, email config, UCM, etc.)
# are managed exclusively in config.json. This .env file is primarily for:
# 1. Plugin-specific API keys or configurations.
# 2. Credentials for other third-party services not managed by Wooster's core.
# 3. Bootstrap LOG_LEVEL for very early console messages before config.json is parsed.

# Example for a hypothetical plugin:
# MY_PLUGIN_API_KEY=
# ANOTHER_PLUGIN_SETTING=some_default_value

# Bootstrap Log Level (optional, primarily for debugging early startup)
# Valid values: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
# This controls console logs BEFORE config.json is loaded.
# After config.json is loaded, logging.consoleLogLevel from config.json takes over.
# LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
